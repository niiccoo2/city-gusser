                <h2>A lot of text</h2>
                <p>There’s something comforting about the quiet rhythm of a slow morning—the kind where light filters through the curtains just enough to tint the walls golden, and the air still carries the stillness of sleep. These are the moments that people often overlook: the pause before the world starts asking things of you, when time doesn’t yet feel like it’s slipping away. In that in-between space, where the clock ticks but no one’s listening, your thoughts are more honest. Maybe that’s when the best ideas come—not with urgency, but with a calm invitation.</p>
